This is an data visualization app project for STAT3622 made with R's shiny and shinydashboard library. The app includes 5 sections:

OVERVIEW - General statistics, correlation graphs and geographical data
CAUSES OF GLOBAL WARMING - Visualization and analysis of the sources of global warming
RELATIONSHIP AMONG COUNTRIES - Categorizes countries with similar environmental performance
EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING - Visualization and analysis of the problems brought by global warming
HELPING INITIATIVES - Explores the effect of global agreements on global warming

The app is hosted at https://dvglobwarm.shinyapps.io/DataViz2-main/. To run it locally, download the this repository and run the app.R file (preferably with RStudio, where a "Run App" button is shown).
